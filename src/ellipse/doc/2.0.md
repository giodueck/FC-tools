# Considerations for Factorio 2.0

## Why?

Deciders are vastly more powerful than before, enabling smaller and more complex logic by bundling decisions with AND and
OR clauses, and by enabling the discrimination of wire colors within all combinators.

Selector combinators introduce sorting and randomness as first class operations.

2 combinator arbitrary memory cells have been designed, with 1 tick of in/out delay.

1 combinator RS latches are now possible.

## What to do

### General design
Redesign memory architecture using new memory tech, and reimagine it from the ground up. This could enable:

- Native multithreading using many signals instead of just the M-signal as I did until now
- Simpler SIMD using the same principle
- Faster memory ops, meaning faster frequency
- More complex instructions by taking advantage of selectors

### Communication protocol
There is also the new radar global channels, which could be used for a communication protocol to control remote circuits.

Design a serial protocol or implement something like SPI or I2C.

### Display protocol
The lamps can now use RGB to set their color, and they can either take 3 8-bit values or a packed 32-bit color.
