# Motivation

## Why?

To get in the mood of creating again, and in preparation for the expansion and 2.0 releases.

## What?

A useful-in-practice processor, with instructions and design choices catered to I/O and speed for use in a (somewhat) realtime factory.

It should also consider the language from the beginning, to avoid unnecessary instructions or bad design choices.

## How?

Designs should go for speed, i.e. minimal lag and clock periods, and performance, i.e. more work with less cycles.
